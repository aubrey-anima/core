All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Versioning is **not** plain semver: the major version *is* the db format version. A world
file is pinned to the engine version that produced it, and there is no cross-version
migration — hosts install one version and depend on that version.

- **Major** — the database format changed. Existing worlds are not readable.
- **Minor** — new capability, same database format.
- **Patch** — fixes, same database format.

`tests/test_version_contract.py` enforces the major/db-format relationship mechanically,
and `db.py` enforces it again at runtime: mounting an incompatible world file is refused
on the spot rather than silently written to.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] — unreleased

First public release. db format **1**, package format **1**.

Everything before this release lives in git history rather than here; the engine went
through several db-format generations during development (memory 2.0, needs, economy,
social each landed as their own format bump) and they were collapsed into a single
format 1 for the first release. Those worlds never left the machines they were built on,
so there is nothing to migrate.

### The engine

- **Event-sourced world core.** An append-only event log is the only source of truth.
  Balances, relationships, locations, and the narrative log are projections of it. There
  is no snapshot table — an earlier one was removed because it wrote back drifted
  balances.
- **Tick-driven scheduler** with the system's single `RLock`, guarding the world clock,
  the projection, and the mailbox.
- **Behavior-tree agents** with an urgency band, a free-time planner, and an action table
  that lives in the database rather than in code.
- **LLM off the tick thread.** Narration, planning, and relationship judging run on
  separate thread pools; the client is injected. A world with no API key runs on
  templates instead of stalling.
- **`World` facade** (`anima_world.api`) — open, drive the clock, read state, chat,
  record turns, move players, hot-edit config. This is the interface host applications
  depend on, and it is add-only from here.
- **Chat subsystem decoupled from the event core.** A whole session emits exactly one
  world event, at close. The world receives only the current turn's bounded history; the
  full transcript stays in the host application.

### Subsystems

- **Memory 2.0** (always on) — retrieval scored on relevance × recency × importance,
  periodic reflection that writes higher-order memories, and a forgetting curve.
- **Needs** (`needs.enabled`, default off) — `energy` / `hunger` / `social` decay per tick
  and drive the behavior tree's urgency band. Checkpointed at day boundaries and on close.
- **Economy** (`economy.enabled`, default off) — items, money, shops, wages, price drift.
  The ledger is a projection of `payment` events.
- **Social** (`social.enabled`, default off) — gossip that propagates second-hand with
  per-hop confidence decay, and emergent cliques. Three-axis relationships are always on.

### Distribution

- **`.cyberworld` packages** — export a world as a template (seed only, builds itself on
  first boot) or a snapshot (a database that has already lived), and import either.
- **CLI**: `start` (guided create + run), `doctor` (health check including a real LLM
  call), `config` (encrypted secrets, masked on read), `run` (foreground host, no
  onboarding), `simulate` (headless fast-forward), `world` (package export/import).
- **Encrypted secrets at rest.** `llm.api_key` is Fernet-encrypted; the key material
  lives in `<db>.key` and must travel with the database.

### Fixed before release

- **The world clock was not persisted.** It was restored as `max(event timestamp)`, so
  every stretch of ticks that produced no event — most of the night — was silently
  discarded on close. A world reported at tick 350 reopened at 320, and the deficit was
  permanent. Now checkpointed to `db_meta` alongside the other data-plane state.
- **An explicitly named seed file that could not be read degraded silently** to the
  built-in demo world. Because a seed is read once into an empty database, a typo in
  `--seed` produced the wrong world permanently. Authored seeds now raise `WorldSeedError`
  with per-field detail; only the bundled seed still falls back.
- **`config --db-path` only worked before the subcommand**, unlike every other command,
  and failed with a bare top-level usage error. Both positions now work.
- **`doctor`'s fix hint omitted `--db-path`**, so a user with a world at a custom path who
  copied the suggested command created a second, empty world at the default path and
  wrote the key into that one.
- Two gossip bugs: a dead branch and a non-reproducible dice roll.

### Removed before release

- **The HTTP layer.** Three REST API groups and membership-claim authentication were
  removed when the engine became a pure library. Network exposure is the host
  application's job. The old protocol is in git history before `e7e3188`.
- **Authoring code.** Authoring moved to a separate desktop application, because a world
  file is pinned to the engine version that produced it and the tool has to hold several
  versions at once.
- The `story` subcommand, an M2-era leftover that no documentation mentioned.
